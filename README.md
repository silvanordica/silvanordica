- 👋 Hi, I’m Matthias (@silvanordica)
- 👀 I’m interested in Hydrodynamical Simulations especially using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) 
  for Astrophysical processes: chemo-dynamical evolution of dwarf galaxies, gas cooling, star formation, 
  stellar feedback processes, chemo-dynamical evolution of the interstellar medium, dark matter 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C#, C++, CUDA, Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Hydrodynamical Simulation Codes
- 📫 How to reach me: matthias.kuehtreiber@univie.ac.at
